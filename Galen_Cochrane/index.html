Assignment 1 â€“ Part I
Purpose: This is an index page for subsequent assignments and
serves as practice for html.

NOTE: The w3 validator recommended in the
assignment complained about having more
than one h1 anywhere in the document, despite
what was discussed in class, so I replaced all
but the most "important" h1 with h2 or h3
where appropriate. This and some other
"semantics" decisions recommended by the
validator were questionable to me,
but I'm sure I'll get sorted out during the
course of this class.
